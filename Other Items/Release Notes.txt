These are the updated ency files.
Do NOT copy them to your regular ency directory, this will be undone by automatic updates. The procedure below is done at your own risk!

1) Copy the original files from 
	Program Files/Other-Life/languages/en 
	to Program Files/Other-Life/languages/de (or some other unused language)
2) Copy the updated files there too, overwriting the original ones
3) Change the language to "de" in Documents/Other-Life/other-life/ol.ini  
Comment: You cannnot change the language in-game
4) Relog and you should be able to use the updated ency files
